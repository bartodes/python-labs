# Python Script For Excel Automation

*Using python openpyxl-3.1.2 library*

Automation of data taken from an Excel file. 

In this case, I had created a simple spreadsheet 'songsFromPlaylist.xlsx'
It has 'songs' that come from a specific 'playlist'.
They have 'artists' and 'listeners'.

| Song | Listeners | Artists | Playlist  |
|------|-----------|---------|-----------|
| 1    | ...       | ...     | Example1  |
| 2    | ...       | ...     | Example2  |
| 3    | ...       | ...     | Example3  |
